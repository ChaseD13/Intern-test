# ToDo-List App
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4fb9d6d5-7ea7-478d-94dd-7cb58bf5f17f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/todo-list-chase/deploys)

## Description
The ToDo-List app was created originally as an intern test. The app does not contain a backend so any tasks created by the user will be deleeted upon refresh/exit. It was created using React and Typescript. From this app I gained an understanding about both React and Typescript and how powerfull both of these resources are.

## Internship at The Dotcom test
Build a To Do List App similar to this: https://to-do-test-app.firebaseapp.com/.

- [X] Total number of uncompleted tasks should display at the bottom
- [X] User should be able to remove tasks from the list.
- [X] User should be able to mark tasks completed.

No backend required (Data does not need to persist).

Utilize React and Mobx (bonus points for Typescript).

Push to a github repo and deploy with a tool of your choice. We recommend Netlify or Firebase.

Commit early and often.  We want to see your process.

Paste the deployed url into the description and readme.md of your repo.  Email us the link to your repo (Please ensure it's public).
