# Internship at The Dotcom test

Build a To Do List App similar to this: https://to-do-test-app.firebaseapp.com/.

* Total number of uncompleted tasks should display at the bottom
* User should be able to remove tasks from the list.
* User should be able to mark tasks completed.

No backend required (Data does not need to persist).

Utilize React and Mobx (bonus points for Typescript).

Push to a github repo and deploy with a tool of your choice. We recommend Netlify or Firebase.

Commit early and often.  We want to see your process.
