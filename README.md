Build a To Do List App similar to this: https://to-do-test-app.firebaseapp.com/.

- [X] Total number of uncompleted tasks should display at the bottom
- [X] User should be able to remove tasks from the list.
- [X] User should be able to mark tasks completed.

No backend required (Data does not need to persist).

Utilize React and Mobx (bonus points for Typescript).

Push to a github repo and deploy with a tool of your choice. We recommend Netlify or Firebase.

Commit early and often.  We want to see your process.

Paste the deployed url into the description and readme.md of your repo.  Email us the link to your repo (Please ensure it's public).
